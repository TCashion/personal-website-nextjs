            This post is inspired by part one of <i>The War of Art</i> by Steven
            Pressfield.

          <p className="prose">
            The major theme in this book is what Pressfield calls the
            Resistance. The Resistance is the enemy within ourselves that
            opposes all of our most important creative ambitions. It manifests
            itself in the form of rationalization, distraction (such as vices
            like alcohol, sex, drugs, etc.), and especially fear. Pressfield
            even posits that we can treat our fear like a compass to guide us
            toward the creative work that is most important to us: the higher
            and more intense the fear, the more likely it is that what causes
            the fear is exactly what we need to pursue and make the main target
            for our energetic focus.

            Not only do I love how well Pressfield writes, but I believe this
            concept is genius. It resonates with me because of all the times I
            know I let the Resistance get in the way of my own pursuits, all the
            habits I have that are the Resistance's way of trying to keep me
            moored to my current state.
          </p>
          <p className="prose">
            The encouraging conclusion I have drawn from reading just part one
            of The War of Art is that I am very fearful. I am fearful of
            failing, of looking like a fool, of not living up to expectations,
            etc. This is encouraging because the presence of fear indicates the
            presence of an organic, ambitious drive rooted in my subconscious,
            creative self. Perhaps I have been looking at fear the wrong way all
            along. Instead of moving in the opposite direction away from fear,
            maybe I should turn my focus 180 degrees in the opposite direction,
            and learn to run toward fear and push myself to overcome it. Easier
            said than done, I know. But Pressfield's piece gives me validation
            that the spoils of the war against the Resistance are well worth the
            battle.
