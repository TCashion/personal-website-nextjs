            The order of operations is always the same. We park our trucks at
            odd angles in the alleyway behind the garage. The radio plays
            classic rock. We crack open beers immediately upon arrival. In the
            cluttered garage, with shelves along the perimeter packed with
            skies, camping gear, and power tools, and where you have to duck in
            order to avoid hitting your head on the yellow kayak hanging from
            the ceiling, we pull two folding tables from between the shelves and
            arrange them in a “T” shape. For cutting boards, two pieces of scrap
            linoleum countertop, complete with backsplashes, sit atop the
            tables. Yellow buckets with towels soaking in a warm vinegar
            solution sit on the ends of the tables. We use these to clean the
            work surfaces, wipe down the knives, and scrub away any dirt or fur
            or leaf litter that still clings to the meat. This operation
            probably wouldn’t pass an FDA inspection, but who cares. It works
            for us.{' '}

            I’ve been lucky to find myself in my friend Mike’s dad Gary’s garage
            at the end of every hunting season for the last several years.
            That’s where we convene each year to undertake the task of
            processing the meat we hunted that season. It’s the final leg of the
            field-to-table cycle, a process that adds up to many hours stretched
            out over the last several weeks. After this, we’ll each have enough
            meat to last us until next season, probably even longer. By the end
            of the night, we’ll hold the final product of all our efforts.
          </p>
          <p className="prose">
            Everyone selects a blade from an arsenal of freshly-sharpened
            knives. We carve chunks from the shoulder quarters and pile the meat
            into a large bowl. These cuts are destined for the grinder. We’ll
            grind them together with pork or beef fat, and a homemade spice
            mixture to make a variety of sausages: Italian, breakfast, chorizo,
            or whatever other recipe moves us on the night of preparation.
            Meanwhile, Gary cuts steaks from the hind quarters. He dismantles
            each quarter by slicing along the edges of the muscle groups. Then,
            he carves the larger muscles down into meal-sized portions.{' '}

          <p className="prose">
            When the are bones clean, we toss a femur to whoever’s dog came
            along for the night. Then, we form an assembly line and prepare for
            packaging. Portions of meat roughly the size of my palm go down the
            line. Each receives an initial protective layer of plastic wrap,
            then an armor layer of white freezer paper wrapped tightly and
            sealed with tape. At the end of the line, a black Sharpie stamps
            each package to demarcate the contents in code. The code describes
            the hunter, the species, the type of meat, and the year: “M. D.
            Tenderloin ‘19.” Mike’s deer, tenderloin, harvested in 2019.{' '}
          </p>
          <p className="prose">
            The white packages stack up at the end of the table like gold ingots
            in a bank vault. Greedily, I watch the stack grow. I imagine how my
            share of the white bricks will look when neatly arranged in pyramid
            formation in my freezer. At the same time, I gloat to myself about
            how the quality of this meat is superior to anything else out there.
            Animals we harvest in the wild feed on wild forage for their entire
            lives. No antibiotics, no steroids, no artificial
            grass-fed-and-grain-finished nonsense. We participate in the
            field-to-table cycle as it unfolds right in front of our eyes. Such
            direct engagement in provenance elicits a wholesome feeling of
            fulfillment that is hard to replicate in other pursuits.{' '}
          </p>
          <p className="prose">
            With wrapping finished, Gary produces a handful of plastic grocery
            bags. He always seems to have a ton of these. We make a final tally
            of the packages, and divide them into piles, one pile per person.
            Each person who helped hunt, pack out, or process the meat gets a
            fair share. I fill a few grocery bags with meat and tie the handles
            closed before lowering them into the cooler in the back of my truck.
            By the time we’re done, it’s late into the night. Time to go home.
            With hugs and smiles, we say goodbye to each other.

            Nights like this have occurred millions of times throughout the
            course of humanity: people dismantling the carcass of a
            freshly-pursued wild animal in order to re-purpose the flesh into
            food. Our intention tonight is the same as our ancestors’ has always
            been: to provide clean game meat as sustenance for our families. Our
            means of accomplishing the task, though, are much different. Instead
            of using hand-made, stone tools, we employ factory-made rifle
            bullets and steel knives. Instead of working by moonlight, we work
            by the light from incandescent bulbs. Instead of hunting out of
            necessity, we hunt by choice, a choice to carry on the intrinsically
            human ritual of hunting, and a choice to eat meat earned in the
            wilderness rather than blindly snagged from a grocery store cooler.
