          In 2019, I took up an interest in endurance training when I decided to
          run my first marathon. It was the Colfax Marathon in Denver, which I
          ran in May 2019. I learned quite a bit during my training, and put up
          a decent time of 4:19. Definitely not a record-breaker, but a number I
          could be happy with for my first long-distance race.{' '}
        </p>
        <p className="prose">
          After the marathon, I took several months off running. The desire to
          run any more after the marathon was completely absent from my mind.
          Instead, I trained with kettlebells, free weights, pullups, circuit
          exercises and the occasional session on the treadmill. By this
          somewhat disorganized approach, I maintained my fitness by showing up
          to the gym as consistently as possible.{' '}

          A couple months ago, the lingering complacency with running began to
          wear off and I started to eye another race this year, which takes
          place in early August, 2020. Learning about the mechanics of fitness
          is a huge part of the pursuit for me. This time around, I wanted to
          take my understanding to an even deeper level. So, a few weeks ago, I
          ordered{' '}
          <span className="underline">The Big Book of Endurance Training</span>{' '}
          by Doctor Phil Maffetone. His big thing is{' '}
          <span className="bold">MAF</span>: <span className="bold">M</span>
          aximum <span className="bold">A</span>erobic{' '}
          <span className="bold">F</span>itness. The premise of the book is
          basically this: your body can burn fuel either aerobically, or
          anaerobically. Aerobic energy pathways primarily burn fat for fuel.
          Anaerobic energy pathways burn carbohydrates (in the form of sugar)
          for fuel. Maffetone says that healthy people and endurance athletes
          should live mainly in the aerobic zone, because fat stores offer a
          much more efficient and plentiful fuel source for the body than
          carbohydrates.
        </p>
        <p className="prose">
          According to Maffetone, the simplest way to tell if a person is
          training aerobically is to measure their heart rate. Based on a
          person’s age and fitness level, aerobic training occurs within a
          calculable range. For me (age 29, moderate fitness level, max heart
          rate 192), the optimal heart rate per Maffetone’s formula is between
          135 - 145 beats per minute (bpm). This means that to increase my
          aerobic fitness, I should aim to keep my heart rate inside this range,
          without exceeding 145 bpm, for the duration of my training sessions.
          If the theory holds truen I should notice that I can run faster and
          longer while maintaining the same heart rate as my aerobic fitness
          increases over time.
        </p>
        <p className="prose">
          Think of aerobic fitness as a holistic measurement of a person's
          overall health. For instance, a guy can be ripped to the gills after
          years of intense weight-lifting and steroid use. He may appear healthy
          on the outside, but if he runs out of breath after climbing a single
          set of stairs (indicating poor aerobic fitness), it's hard to argue
          that his health is actually in goods shape. If what Maffetone wrote is
          true, then training with MAF in mind will combat this type of
          off-balance scenario, ultimately creating an athlete that can perform
          at high levels with a steady heart rate compared to an unfit person.
        </p>
        <p className="prose">
          The roided-out meat-head that can’t climb the stairs is an extreme
          example. But, this scenario is sort of where I found myself this
          winter. I realized after flipping through <u>The Big Book</u> that my
          aerobic fitness is quite limited, despite my regular trips to the gym.
          Ostensibly, I look like a healthy and fit person. But if you measure
          my heart rate while I run around the park by my house, I can barely
          hit a 13:00 minute/mile pace before my heart rate jumps over 145 bpm.
          So, with the goal of increasing my aerobic fitness and thereby
          improving my overall health, I’ll put the MAF theory to the test.
          That’s the purpose of this post, which will be an ongoing log of
          milestones in my training.

        <h3 className="prose-heading">Training Approach:</h3>
        <p className="prose">
          My race takes place in August. Until then, I plan to focus intently on
          building my aerobic base. For the first iteration, I will follow these
          basic rules:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Always warm up for a minimum of 12-minutes, gradually increasing
            heart rate from resting rate to MAF. Cool down length of 12 minutes,
            as well.
          </li>
          <li>Train aerobically (inside MAF) for the majority of sessions.</li>
          <li>
            Alternate with the occasional anaerobic training session, using
            short HIIT sessions as the primary method. After continuing my
            research in order to cross-check Maffetone's priniciples, I made the
            decision to incorporate high-intensity interval training (HIIT) into
            my plan. This mainly came from what I read in{' '}
            <span className="underline">
              Power Speed Endurance: A Skill-Based Approach to Endurance
              Training
            </span>{' '}
            by Brian MacKenzie, and{' '}
            <span className="underline">The 4-Hour Body</span> by Tim Ferriss
            (which heavily includes Brian MacKenzie in the secion about
            ultra-marathon training). What I gleaned from these sources is that
            HIIT trains the body to more readily revert to aerobic fuel
            pathways. In other words, during the “high-intensity” phase, the
            body burns carbohydrates anaerobically, but during the rest periods,
            the body reverts to burning fat aerobically. Training the body to
            switch back and forth like this improves its ability to access
            aerobic pathways (mechanics of this beyond my expertise).
          </li>
          <li>
            Never more than one anaerobic/HIIT session in a row. Alternate days
            of anaerobic and aerobic training.
          </li>
          <li>
            During HIIT sessions, if my heart rate does not return to 120 bpm
            within 120 seconds of rest, then the session is done (this rule
            courtesy of Tim Ferriss, 4HB).

          <span className="underline">February 25th:</span> I performed my
          baseline MAF test on a treadmill. Here are the results:

          <li>Mile 3 pace: 13:28</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="prose">
          Notes: 12-minute warmup, approx. 12-min cool-down. See heart rate data
          to the right.
        </p>
        <p className="prose">
          After this session, I trained most days in aerobic fashion with only
          one or two days of anaerobic training (mainly pullups, to maintain the
          work I’ve put in over the past few months). For aerobic workouts, I
          primarily did kettlebell swings with a lighter, 15 lb kettlebell. I
          found I could do swings with this weight for 10 minutes straight and
          maintain 140-145 bpm.
        </p>
        <p className="prose">
          <span className="underline">March 9th:</span> I did a shorter,
          follow-up treadmill session to check status.
        </p>
        <p className="prose">MAF Status Test: 145 max HR</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Mile 1 pace: 11:25 (30-second improvement since 2/25!)</li>
          <li>Mile 2 pace: data lost (fat fingers hit the “reset” button)</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="prose">
          Notes: breathing cadence 3x7 then 3x5 (meaning inhale lasts duration
          of 3 steps, exhale lasts duration of 7 or 5 steps). I’ve found that a
          shorter inhale and longer exhale helps me maintain a more steady heart
          rate. Inhale should always be through the nose when training
          aerobically.
