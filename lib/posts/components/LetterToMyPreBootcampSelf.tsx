          There are a handful of things I would have liked to hear when I was
          considering enrolling in a coding bootcamp. I thought I'd share them
          here, in case I can give others that last motivational push to take
          the leap of faith. Here are my thoughts:
        </p>
        <h3 className="prose-heading">Just by signing up, you're a winner.</h3>
        <p className="prose">
          Enrolling in a bootcamp takes some serious guts. Leaving behind a
          stable job and regular pay can be daunting. Even if your job is not
          stable or comfortable, going 12+ weeks without pay is extremely scary.
          Just keep this in mind: you're making a career change, which is not a
          trivial undertaking by any definition. You're investing in yourself
          and in your future, and that alone is reason enough to be proud.
        </p>
        <h3 className="prose-heading">You'll meet some incredible people.</h3>
        <p className="prose">
          One of my favorite things about bootcamp is that my classmates all had
          entire careers prior to enrolling. The combination of diverse
          backgrounds coupled with the fact that these people all had the gusto
          to make the aforementioned leap of faith inherently meant that I was
          studying alongside some true badasses. The opportunity to work
          alongside a group like this is in itself a great reason to enroll.

        <h3 className="prose-heading">
          The more you know going in, the better.
        </h3>
        <p className="prose">
          Some bootcamps require substantial prior coding knowledge as a barrier
          for entry. Others are catered to complete beginners, and then there
          are those that fall somewhere in between. Regardless of what program
          you decide on, study and understand as many of the fundamentals as you
          possibly can prior to beginning your course. This will save you from
          being totally lost when the content really takes off a few weeks into
          your class. Here are a few resources to help you learn the
          fundamentals:

          When you graduate, you're not done learning.

          If you are thinking about changing careers into software and web
          development, you better love to learn! This is exactly what attracted
          me to the field: it's an endless rabbit hole of new material to absorb
          and problems to solve. Even after graduating from bootcamp, I found
          that most employers did not see me as a qualified job candidate on
          paper. You'll likely experience the same, so keep up the momentum.
          Take tutorials, tinker with new languages and frameworks, and most
          importantly (in my humble opinion), start contributing to open source
          projects. Employers like open source experience because it's a great
          indicator that you know how to collaborate with others, understand
          someone else's code base, and participate in the development lifecycle
          of a large project. I found this article to be extremely helpful in
          getting started with open source projects.

          The job search is more work than the bootcamp.
        </h3>
        <p className="prose">
          If nothing else, the job search is a major exercise in how to handle
          rejection. Even if you don't have thick skin going in, you'll come out
          of the experience with the tough, scaly exterior or a rhinoceros. It's
          just the nature of the job search. Expect that you'll likely submit
          dozens, or even hundreds, of applications before you land a job. Enjoy
          the journey, accept it as an opportunity to grow, and when you get
          rejected, don't take it personally.
        </p>
        <h3 className="prose-heading">You can do it.</h3>
        <p className="prose">
          Doubt is a built-in emotional response that's there to help guide you
          through life, especially when you're taking a risk. If doubt bubbles
          up when you think about your coding bootcamp, take note of it, accept
          it for what it is, and take a step forward anyway. Don't let doubt get
          in the way of pursuing the career of your dreams.
