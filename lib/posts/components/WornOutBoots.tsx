            The condition of a hunter’s boots is directly correlated to effort
            expended in the field. It takes time and mileage to wear out a good
            pair. When they get to the point that they are no longer functional
            or wearable, that probably means you’ve earned it. My first hunting
            boots were a pair of Danner Pronghorns with eight inches of ankle
            support and 400g of insulation. I bought them the year after I
            graduated college. By that time, I had a job and some disposable
            income, but I still toiled over the details of the purchase. After
            browsing through the various options, I finally tried on several
            pairs. When I got to the Danners and put them on, the inside of the
            boot felt like it had been designed around a mold of my foot. All
            other factors went out the window: it was the right fit and my
            decision was made.{' '}

            Not only were they my first boots, they were also one of the first
            pieces of hunting gear I ever owned. I wore them on my very first
            big game hunt, when I carried a borrowed rifle because I did not
            have my own yet. Some friends and I drew mule deer tags and we
            hunted the sagebrush expanses of northern Colorado. We saw no deer,
            except for two does we spotted a half mile away, already bounding
            away from us.{' '}

            The following year, I went on my first elk hunt. The boots came with
            me on that trip, too. This time I had my own rifle, a used Remington
            700 .30-06. My uncle Tony drove up from Arizona to meet me in
            southern Colorado, where we each had an over-the-counter bull tag.
            We hunted five days and never saw an elk. On the afternoon of the
            last day, I walked along an old logging road back to the truck. The
            hunt was over. Tears welled up in my eyes as I choked down the
            thought of another skunked hunt. Out of frustration I began picking
            up large rocks and hurling them at the hillside. My rifle banged
            against my shoulder with every throw. I wanted so badly to have my
            first successful hunt. I thought I could get back at the mountain
            for having stolen those five days away from me. Of course, I was
            throwing rocks at noone, getting back at nothing. The frustration
            lingered for a while, but retrospectively I see how valuable the
            experience was. Having skunked on my first couple of hunts taught me
            that hunting is about much more than just shooting animals.

            As time went on, I got more hunts under my belt. My first taste of
            success came when two friends and I each killed does on the same
            morning within 100 yards of each other. We dragged all three of them
            to one spot for cleaning. Our fourth friend, the only one with some
            experience, gave us a clinic on how to clean a deer. The next year,
            I harvested my first elk, a cow out on the western slope of
            Colorado. A few weeks after that, I got my first buck. Those Danners
            were on my feet for every day of those trips.{' '}

            My interest in hunting went on a steep trajectory, and my obsession
            led me to buy a compound bow using a credit card since I didn’t have
            the cash. I bowhunted with my friend Joel for two consecutive
            seasons, skunking on those hunts but continuing to refine my skills.
            Each November, we returned to the Colorado sagebrush to fill our
            deer tags. One year I killed a doe that was heavily infected with
            chronic wasting disease and had to throw away all of the meat. The
            year after that I shot an even bigger buck than before. In the
            offseasons I expanded my quarry to rabbits, squirrels, pheasants,
            and turkeys, most of which I did alone because I had a hard time
            convincing anyone to spend a Saturday or Sunday shooting pine
            squirrels. But my boots kept me good company on these adventures.{' '}

          <p className="prose">
            My Danners spent countless hours with me in the field, through
            sunshine, snow, and rain. They were on my feet for every mistake I
            made and during every victory I celebrated. They were with me each
            time I crested a hill and found myself breathless from a seemingly
            endless view. They’ve had blood on them. They’ve walked by accident
            between a mother bear and her cubs. They’ve stomped on the dirt to
            scare away mountain lions. And through everything, they never, ever
            complained.{' '}

          <p className="prose">
            As I grew from a complete beginner to a somewhat experienced hunter,
            my boots steadily showed more scars. The leather turned from dark
            brown to light tan, the eyelets made of webbing gradually broke
            until only a few remained, and water began to penetrate the toe box
            whenever I walked through wet grass. I’m grateful to my boots for
            having kept me company through my adventures. As I retire them and
            move on to my next pair, and then the next, and then the next, they
            will always be the benchmark for what defines a good pair of boots.
            It’s hard to say goodbye. To be honest, though, I’ll probably keep
            them in the back of the garage, just in case I ever need them in a
            pinch.{' '}
