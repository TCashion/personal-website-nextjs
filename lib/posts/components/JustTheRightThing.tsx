            The stress was piling on. The "fires" were popping up left and
            right. Urgent phone calls had to be made. My head was spinning. I
            had to take a walk...
          </p>
          <p className="prose">
            I took my normal route, breathing deep into my belly to calm myself.
            As I reached the turnaround point of my route (a big pond full of
            ducks, geese, blackbirds, cormorants, etc.), I finally felt the
            tension loosening its grip. Just as I was nearing the point where I
            could give myself permission to let go, just as the sense of calm
            and freedom stress began to return, just then...
          </p>
          <p className="prose">
            I looked up to see two ducklings splashing in the pond together like
            children, diving in and out of the water in some game, with Mama
            duck swimming vigilantly and protectively between me and them. That
            was when the grip loosened. I couldn't help but smile.
